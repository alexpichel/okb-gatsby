#### PROBLEMATIC BEHAVIOR OR ACTIVITY

Parole and Probation Officers' large caseloads have made it impossible to adequately supervise offenders receiving downward departures or those released on Short Term Transitional leave and achieve positive outcomes.

As a result, a high percentage of offenders sentenced to downward departures in 2014 are returning to court and being sentenced to the Department of Corrections because they did not successfully complete probation. In addition, eligible applicants for Short Term Transitional Leave are met with great resistance in Crook County due to an inability to intensively supervise them upon release, as well as a shortage of housing and employment.

Currently, there are approximately 15-20 supervised offenders who qualified for a downward departure and two who qualified for Short Term Trans Leave. Both of these populations are projected to increase with the implementation of this program.

#### IMPACT ON THE COMMUNITY

Without intensive supervision, this population of offenders is more likely to continue to victimize citizens in the community. Crook County is also less able to consider allowing more eligible offenders to be supervised locally through a downward departure or Short Term Trans Leave.

## ![Solution Icon](https://github.com/google/material-design-icons/raw/master/action/1x_web/ic_lightbulb_outline_black_48dp.png "Solution") Solution

#### PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

This program creates a new position and program structure designed to provide intensive supervision to offenders receiving a downward departure or Short Term Trans Leave. As the caseload of this position will be considerably less, the officer will be much more active in the community with the offender, assisting in making employment contacts, finding housing, coordinating with DHS/Child Welfare, accessing medical care and treatment, and obtaining necessary identification such as a driver’s license or Social Security card. This program is designed to obtain and use all resources necessary to support offenders in the community and reduce recidivism.

#### BASED ON RESEARCH

* Use of validated risk-assessment tool – LS/CMI
* Case plans entered into Corrections Information System (CIS)
* Use of cognitive behavioral therapy
* Officer training and certification through DPSST

#### FUNDING

.5 FTE of the officer’s salary is paid with an $85,889 grant through the Justice Reinvestment Grant Program.

#### PROGRAM IMPACT

Proposed outcomes for supervised population include:

* Lower short- and long-term recidivism rates
* Increase in acceptance of STTL applicants
* Increase in downward departures
* Decrease in new violations
* Decrease in revocations
* Decrease in offender drug use
