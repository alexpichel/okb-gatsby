#### PROBLEMATIC BEHAVIOR OR ACTIVITY

This program was developed as part of Justice Reinvestment, a statewide initiative to reduce prison use after a nearly 50 percent increase in Oregon’s prison rate from 2000 and 2010. In order to meet the goals of Justice Reinvestment, Columbia County sought to develop long term sustainable evidence-based programming to serve high risk/high need offenders under community supervision (including alternative incarceration programs), Short Term Transitional Leave applicants accepted by the county, offenders on probation, and offenders on post-prison supervision.

#### IMPACT ON THE COMMUNITY

Since 2009, Columbia County general fund revenue has fallen by approximately 32 percent. Local public safety agencies are largely dependent on general fund revenues and have therefore seen drastic cuts. In 2014, budget cuts threatened closure of the jail facility, which would limit the availability of local sanctioning processes. Community-based program efforts help to expand collaboration efforts and encourage the efficient use of resources and safe alternatives to custody.
