Problematic Behavior or Activity

Curry County Community Corrections analyzed a snapshot of the completed Level of Service/Case Management Inventory (LS/CMI) assessments among adults countywide to identify the areas of highest need. The data indicated that alcohol and other drug problems were the highest need; second was antisocial personality; and criminal companions and pro-criminal attitudes were tied for the third-highest need.
Impact on the Community

Without the proper dosage of cognitive behavior intervention—supported by mental health and substance use disorder treatment—the high-risk offenders assessed with these needs are at increased risk to recidivate and pose a threat to public safety.

Program Description

The Curry County Thinking for a Change Program revolves around the cognitive behavioral curriculum Thinking for a Change. Curry County Community Corrections strives to deliver the program with fidelity by closely following the curriculum and adhering to the original approach. In addition, Curry County Community Corrections is partnering with Curry Community Health, which will provide addiction and mental health services.

Thinking for a Change consists of 25 lessons, each of them one to two hours long. Based on assessment, additional services may be provided, including the following:

    substance use disorder treatment
    mental health care
    psycatric evaluation
    medication management
    case management
    skills training
    supported employment
    peer support

Curry County Community Corrections will pilot a Thinking for a Change program for 10 participants during the first six months of the grant period, to determine whether any adjustments need to be made based on participants’ and facilitators’ feedback. People enrolled in this program will receive services when they are in the community or in custody.

Successful completetion will be defined as follows:

    completion of the Thinking for a Change program;
    having no new criminal charges during the grant period; and
    remaining under supervision for the duration of the grant or until released.

Program Impact

Proposed outcomes include the following:

    serving 52 people during the life of the grant with the goal of a 65 percent success rate.
    decreasing the number of offenders sent to prison by offering mental health and substance use disorder treatment in the community, within the framework of an evidence-based practice (Thinking for a Change).
    improving public safety and reducing recidivism by addressing mental health and substance use disorders.
    holding offenders accountable by having a team of professionals with relevant areas of expertise work with program participants. Offenders will also develop internal accountability—that is, being accountable to themselves—an important factor in long-term success.
