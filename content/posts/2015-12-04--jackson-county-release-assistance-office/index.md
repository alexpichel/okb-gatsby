Problematic Behavior or Activity

The Pretrial Release Office at the Jackson County Circuit Court was fully eliminated in 2012. Since the elimination of the Office there have been many forced releases, 1258 in 2014, due to the jail reaching its capacity. The Jackson County jail population is comprised of 65% pre-trial defendants.

Impact on the Community

Forced release of offenders without conditions or monitoring increases the risk of failure to appear. Some of those individuals may be more appropriate than others for pretrial release. Offenders who are released without conditions of supervision or do not have access to day reporting services are at higher risk of non-compliance.
