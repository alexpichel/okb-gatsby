The difficulties of recruitment are a well-recognized issue in the public safety community for both police and corrections agencies. In recent years, a shortage of qualified applicants has been identified as a main difficulty. Effective recruitment strategies include a clear vision of the agency’s brand and ideal candidate, as well as community input in what they, as community members, believe is a desirable candidate.

This report stems from a workgroup sponsored by the National Institute of Corrections and is available via the PDF link provided above. Below are a collection of important points that may apply to present and future recruitment practices of the Oregon DOC. Chapter Three, “Recruitment – Looking in the Right Places for the Right People” is specifically of interest.

- Finding new applicants has been reported by approximately 86% of employers as “difficult.”

- The difficulty often lies in the prevalence of organizational models that do not appeal to the newest generation of workers.

- *Word of Mouth* is one of the most effective recruitment techniques, so a department’s reputation can either be an asset or serious liability.

- Millennials tend to be self-sufficient, self-assured, and more self-focused. This up and coming workforce is looking for jobs that “encompass all of the nonmonetary aspects of the job – flexibility, autonomy, family friendliness, challenge, self-satisfaction, career development, and upward advancement.”

- Consider the “Where” question in regards to finding new applicants:
  - Colleges & Universities
  - High Schools
  - Military/Veterans
  - Social Media

- Consider tracking where applicants were recruited to determine effectiveness of recruitment tactics.

[Police recruitment and retention in the Contemporary Urban environment](http://a-capp.msu.edu/sites/default/files/files/CF261FINAL_RRSummit.pdf)

This is a summary of a National Summit on Police Recruitment and Retention in the Contemporary Urban Environment put on by the COPS office in June 2008. A number of examples are provided regarding recruitment strategies used by agencies around the nation.

- Online:
  - Using the internet to advertise, including a recruitment website that included an online application process and videos on academy
    life and public safety careers.
  - Regular e-mail on the progress of applications
  - Streamlined application process that cut down on the time from application to hire.
  - When visiting website, users should have no problem figuring out  if you are hiring, understand goals, standards, candidate
    requirements and selection, as well as wages and benefit packages (Recruitment Toolkit)

- School-based:
  - After-school and Summer employment for students interested in police work
  - Post-high school employment as civilian employees
  - Support for college education in exchange for a commitment to the department
  - Partnering with local criminal justice programs

- Retention-Based:
  - “Stay” interviews with current employee to paint a picture of what officers are looking for and what type of candidate would fit in
    a stay with the department.
  - Identify internal reasons that negatively affect retention and may also work against successful recruitment.

- Agency:
  - Recruitment videos that highlight certain aspects of department culture that may appeal to the population an agency is aiming to
  attract.
  - Marketing strategies that highlight values that are important to both the department and the candidates.
  - Administering exams used in the application process monthly
  - Offering recruitment bonuses to employees, establishing a department recruiting team
