#### PROBLEMATIC BEHAVIOR OR ACTIVITY

Victims have a right to receive prompt restitution from an offender who is convicted of the act that caused them injury or loss. However, victims sometimes struggle to navigate restitution documentation procedures so that accurate restitution amounts can be appropriately presented to the court.

#### IMPACT ON THE COMMUNITY

Victims are not always receiving, and offenders are not always being held accountable, for prompt and proper restitution.

#### PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

The Restitution Advocate position assists victims with the restitution process during a criminal case. This position works directly with victims to gather estimates and other documents. Once the documentation is compiled, the Restitution Advocate assists in submitting details to the court. This information is ultimately ordered and entered into a judgement.

#### BASED ON RESEARCH

Studies have shown that restitution can create awareness in offenders of the harmful consequences of their actions to the victim. It also holds offenders accountable by requiring them to take action to make amends to the victim and the community.

#### FUNDING

.11 FTE of the advocate’s salary is paid with a $14,000 grant through the 2015-17 Justice Reinvestment Grant Program.

#### PROGRAM IMPACT

Proposed outcomes include:

25 unduplicated clients will receive assistance in organizing and documenting restitution.

90% of victims will agree that the Victim Assistance Program provided them with services that helped them make informal choices about their situations.
