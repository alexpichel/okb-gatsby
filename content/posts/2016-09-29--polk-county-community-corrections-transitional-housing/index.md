#### PROBLEMATIC BEHAVIOR OR ACTIVITY

Polk County lacks sufficient transitional housing for male and female offenders, particularly sex offenders, after they leave jail or prison.

#### IMPACT ON THE COMMUNITY

The shortage of housing for these populations resulted in an increase of homeless people in the community, included sex offenders without a reported address.

#### PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

Polk County Community Corrections offers 30-day transitional housing in three locations. The department office has three beds for men, mainly sex offenders. Community Corrections also has two rooms with single beds at a local motel that can house male or female offenders. The third location is a program called River of Life, which has three beds for men who are not sex offenders.

#### FUNDING

This program is funded through the Justice Reinvestment Grant Program.
