#### PROBLEMATIC BEHAVIOR OR ACTIVITY

To reduce the number of Department of Corrections prison intakes in Washington County, IRISS provides the Court an enhanced community supervision alternative to prison; uses risk, needs, and responsivity to determine viable sentence options; creates and enforces evidence-based conditions of supervision; and holds offenders accountable through improved matching of supervision, services, and sanctions based upon the needs of offenders.

Successful transition into the community includes assessments of the following domains: Reduction in Risk/Needs Factors through the LS/CMI; Stages of Change; Stability-Independence; Sobriety-Support; Transition Coping Skills; and Attitude Orientation.

#### IMPACT ON THE COMMUNITY

Without intensive supervision, this population of offenders is more likely to continue to victimize citizens in the community. Washington County is also less able to consider allowing more eligible offenders to be supervised locally through a downward departure or Short Term Trans Leave.

#### PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

Community Corrections worked in partnership with other Washington County Public Safety organizations to evaluate their criminal justice system. Prior to sentencing, the Court refers felony drug and property offenders for a presentence IRISS assessment. The assessment provides the Court a recommendation regarding system response options to manage the defendant in the community if appropriate. Recommendations are based on individual criminogenic risk and needs criteria that identify whether the defendant may be a candidate for community supervision.

Each of the service components play a crucial role assisting the offender in remaining crime-free and achieving pro-social behaviors. Service components include:

1. Recovery Mentors: responsible for connecting offenders to community support, treatment, housing, and individualized support. An additional Employment Recovery Mentor assists participants in job search and employment retention.

2. Housing: offender eligibility to reside in a clean and sober house to facilitate recovery

3. Substance Abuse: a Continuum of Care Outpatient Treatment Services provide a range of services delivered consistent with the medical necessity.

4. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy: completion of two different but complementary cognitive behavioral experiences.

#### BASED ON RESEARCH

Validated Risk Assessment Tools used include PSC, LS/CMI, URICA , and TCU Drug Screen.
Case plans are entered into Corrections Information System (CIS) and Offender Management System (OMS).
Cognitive Behavioral Therapy includes Moral Reconation Therapy (MRT) and Thinking for Change.
