#### PROBLEMATIC BEHAVIOR OR ACTIVITY

Whether leaving jail or prison, offenders face many challenges as they transition from custody back into the community. Harney County currently lacks coordinated support services to enhance accountability and reduce barriers to reentry for the offenders releasing to their county.

#### IMPACT ON THE COMMUNITY

Without a broad range of coordinated services and support, it is more likely that offenders will recidivate upon release. This leads to increased victimization in the community and places a greater strain on already stretched criminal justice resources.

#### PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

Harney County’s Reentry Court will serve individuals who have been released from prison or have violated their terms of supervision. The Reentry Court team will consist of the judge, defense attorney, district attorney, probation/parole officer, law enforcement officer, coordinator and treatment provider. Available services include mental health counseling, substance abuse treatment, housing assistance, public benefit assistance, employment services, educational and training programs, vocational programs, peer support, and family assistance. The Reentry Court team will guide, coordinate, and monitor these services as needed, based on the individual’s needs and risk. Participants will have regular court hearings and there will be graduated sanctions for noncompliance, as well as incentive to recognize and encourage progress.

#### BASED ON RESEARCH

Use of appropriate balance of services, treatment, and supervision.

#### FUNDING

This program will be partially funded by a $58,410 grant through the 2015-2017 Justice Reinvestment Grant Program. Harney County will also be applying for additional grant funding to support the Court.
