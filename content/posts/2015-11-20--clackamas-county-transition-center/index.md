#### PROBLEMATIC BEHAVIOR OR ACTIVITY

Every year, 350 people are released from the Department of Corrections to Clackamas County. Another 13,000 are released from the Clackamas County Jail, many with little to no prerelease intervention, assessment, or planning. Whether leaving jail or prison, these offenders often face similar challenges accessing treatment, finding housing and employment, and obtaining health care services. Without prerelease intervention and a warm handoff to the community, these individuals are less likely to successfully transition and more likely to commit new crimes.

In addition, a portion of those releasing from the local jail are considered “frequent flyers.” Many of these individuals suffer from undertreated mental illness and are primarily committing nuisance crimes that cause them to cycle in and out of the system. This population accounts for about 1,825 jail beds per year in Clackamas County. Currently, law enforcement lacks an alternative other than jail for this population.

#### IMPACT ON THE COMMUNITY

Without ongoing, coordinated support in the community, individuals releasing from custody are more likely to recidivate. This increases victimization and places a strain on already tight criminal justice resources.

#### PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

The Clackamas County Transition Center provides a centralized location where clients releasing from custody or who are at risk of returning to custody can seamlessly access reentry services. These services include health care, treatment, mental health services, peer mentors, employment assistance, housing, and GED programming. For STTL clients, Center staff conduct reach-ins during incarceration to begin assessments, develop a transition plan, and initiate services.

The Transition Center also serves clients with low criminality but a high mental health need when they are in crisis. This gives law enforcement another viable option for these high need clients other than the local jail. Center staff are able to focus on stabilizing the client first and then assist them in accessing services.

#### BASED ON RESEARCH

- [What Works: Effective Recidivism Reduction and Risk-Focused Prevention Programs: A Compendium of Evidence-Based Options for Preventing New and Persistent Criminal Behavior](https://cdpsdocs.state.co.us/ccjj/Resources/Ref/WhatWorks2008.pdf)
- Guided by the risk, need, responsivity principle
- Use of validated risk/need tools including LS/CMI, LSI-R:SV, PSC, Proxy
- Use of cognitive behavioral therapy, primarily Moral Reconation Therapy
- Offers clients gender specific services when available

#### FUNDING

This program is funded by a $1,517,273 grant through the 2015-17 Justice Reinvestment Grant Program. This grant supports staff, contractual services for treatment and education, drug testing, program supplies, and equipment.

- Increase in clients engaged in treatment services upon release
- Decrease in new violations
- Lower recidivism rates
- Decrease in use of jail for clients in mental health crisis
