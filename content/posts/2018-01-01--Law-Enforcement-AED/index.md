#### PROBLEMATIC BEHAVIOR OR ACTIVITY

Law enforcement officer generally arrive to a cardiac event before responding medical personnel. Studies have proven immediate live saving efforts consisting of AED use and High Performance CPR have increased survival rates to 80% to 91%. Prior to implementation of every patrol vehicle being equipped with and AED and officers training with updated CPR techniques, citizen had less of a chance of surviving a cardiac event.

#### IMPACT ON THE COMMUNITY

Citizen were dying and not getting the fastest medical attention as possible.

#### PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

AED’s and High Performance CPR have proven to save lives. Each patrol vehicle and all officers have been trained on how to provide High Performance CPR and use an AED to save citizens suffering from a cardiac event. since the program was started, one live was save as a direct result of the program. Several other deployments were made which the AED indicated a shock and CPR were not advised.

#### BASED ON RESEARCH

Cities such as Bend, Oregon and Seattle Washington have seen and documented a higher percentages of life’s saved when a sudden cardiac event has occurred and witnessed. The percentage increases even more when High Performance CPR and an AED were used.

Between 2012 and 2014, the City of Bend Fire Department increased witnessed sudden cardiac events by 30%. King County Washington averaged 26% survival rate in 2002 but greatly increased the survival rate of a sudden cardiac event in 2013 and averaged 62% survival rate. In 2016, The Bend Fire Department recorded a gain of 71% in their witness sudden cardiac arrests. This is a direct reflection of the implementation of High Performance CPR and AED usage. These survival rates can be linked to increasing first responding law enforcement officers the availability of AED’s in patrol vehicles and the use of High Performance CPR.

The American Heart Association published an article titled, Emergency Medical Services Dispatch Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Pre-arrival Instructions to Improve Survival from Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest. This article was endorsed by the Association of Public-Safety Communications Officials International, International Academies of Emergency Dispatch, National Academies of Emergency Dispatch, National Association of Emergency Medical Technicians, National Association of EMS Physicians and the National Association of State EMS Officials. Contributors to the article consisted of numerous medical personal and consultants.

The article covers the topic of EMS Dispatch guidelines. These are the standards set for dispatch when assisting the public with CPR during a witnessed sudden cardiac arrest. It is a thorough, step by step process used by dispatchers in order to start the CPR process as soon as possible and before the arrival of first responders.

A second article prepared by CARES addresses Cardiac Arrest Registry to Enhance Survival. The data collection process is defined. This article lists the actions taken and supported to ensure accurate statics are documented. Implementation of the registry is explained and how it has expanded into a nationally recognized data base. Case reporting is clarified with over 13,0000 out-of-hospital cardiac arrests listed which is supported by receiving 95% of eligible cases.

#### FUNDING

My goal is to present this issue faced by the Prineville Police Department and directly effects the lives of our community members, to The DPSST, The Center for Policing Excellence. By presenting this project and being selected as a micro-grant recipient, I will be able to purchase AED’s for every patrol vehicle and see our officers get the training needed to be proficient in High Performance CPR. A life saved is a solution in its self.

Crook County Fire Rescue is currently using Zoll AED’s. Crook County Fire Rescue has agreed to replace any Zoll, AED CPR-D-Padz, used by first responding officers used during a sudden cardiac arrest. These pads are valued at $169.00 per set. If this project is selected as a micro-grant recipient, Zoll AED’s could be purchased for each patrol vehicle at the Prineville Police Department. The basic price for each Zoll AED is $1195.00. This would include all patrol officers vehicles and sergeants vehicles. Any remaining balance received from the grant could be applied to additional training in High Performance CPR.

The micro-grant was awarded to our agency and 12 AED’s were purchased for $15.000.00.

#### PROGRAM IMPACT

Since the implementation of this program, patrol officers now respond to every medical call for service in the City of Prineville related to a possible cardiac event. Our officers work as a team with responding Crook County Fire Rescue to provide the best care for the citizen as possible. As a result of this program, the life of a Prineville citizen was saved and an officer was recognized by receiving a life saving award. Within the first year of the program, over 20 deployments were made and one life saved.

#### CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

The most notable contribution to the program is by-inn by officers responding to a medical call for service. Officers learn the importance of rapid response to a medical event by law enforcement. The training they received and mind set of working with medics to save lives became standard operating procedure.

#### LESSONS LEARNED

I would recommend meeting with your local medical response personal. Set up a partnership in using training and equipment to they are familiar with. Work with fire rescue and see what is is they expect or would like law enforcement to do when responding to a cardiac event. Encourage your officers to assist with a cardiac event and discontinue any past practices of “This is a medical call and not criminal”. I have first hand experience with two separate agencies where this program has saved lives. Once an officer has this type of experience or similar , they will support the program without hesitation.
