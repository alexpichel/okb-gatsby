#### PROBLEMATIC BEHAVIOR OR ACTIVITY

This program was developed as part of Justice Reinvestment, a statewide effort to reduce prison use after a nearly 50 percent increase in Oregon’s incarceration rate from 2000 to 2010. In an effort to reduce the number of people Union County sends to state prison, the county chose to maximize the number of approved short-term transitional leave applicants, increase communication between parole and probation officers and the District Attorney’s office regarding downward departures, and expand service and treatment options available to offenders under community supervision.

#### IMPACT ON THE COMMUNITY

Without intensive supervision, this population is are more likely to continue to victimize citizens in the community.

#### PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

Offenders receiving downward departures or reentering the community through short-term transitional leave (STTL) are placed under intensive supervision and receive programming that includes cognitive behavioral therapy and day reporting. Those on STTL also have access to transitional housing. The goal of the program is a high frequency of contact and a balance of sanctions and services in order to change behavior and prevent future recidivism.
For someone entering the program pre-sentencing, a screening assessment is conducted and information is shared between the District Attorney’s office and the adult parole and probation office regarding the defendant’s appropriateness for community supervision. Offenders determined to qualify for a downward departure are required to enter the intensive supervision program for six months at the beginning of their original supervision plan based on their sentence.
