#### PROBLEMATIC BEHAVIOR OR ACTIVITY

Dwindling budgets have made it difficult to get more done with fewer resources. As a result, projects deemed less critical may end up being put on hold.

#### IMPACT ON THE COMMUNITY

The community benefits greatly from the Auxiliary Unit, as some projects simply wouldn’t happen without its help.

#### PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

Auxiliary unit volunteers help out in numerous ways. They assist with community outreach projects, administrative projects, and in other capacities when their skills, talent, and interest match the needs of the sheriff’s office. Auxiliary team members do not engage in active law enforcement activities and are not a substitute for fully trained and certified deputies. Rather, Auxiliary team members help stretch resources in a supportive role.

They have assisted with the following duties and others:

- Compiling and editing the Sheriff’s Office newsletter
  - Setting up the speed trailer and doing speed surveys
  - Staffing the Drug Take Back event
  - Scanning booking and offender files
  - Conducting customer service surveys
  - Helping coordinate the sheriff’s office Citizens’ Academy
  - Supporting crime prevention programs

#### FUNDING

No funding is necessary. The only money spent on the program has been for volunteer shirts and hats, award pins, and periodic rewards. The Auxiliary unit helped run an event that raised a small amount of money that has sustained the program’s purchase of these items for several years.
