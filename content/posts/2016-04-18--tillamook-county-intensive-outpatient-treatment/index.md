Problematic Behavior or Activity

This program was developed as part of Oregon’s Justice Reinvestment initiative, a statewide effort to reduce prison use after Oregon’s prison incarceration rate increased by nearly 50 percent from 2000 to 2010. More than 40 percent of people currently in the state’s prisons are there due to illicit drug use, but on average, only 12 percent are enrolled in treatment.
Impact on the Community

Unlawful drug use may lead to crimes committed to support an addiction. Tillamook County sought to increase the number of defendants offered downward-departure sentences with appropriate treatment programs and other sanctions that are alternatives to incarceration. Close monitoring and intensive outpatient treatment will encourage offenders to remain drug-free, which improves public safety and quality of life in the community.

Program Description

Tillamook County’s Intensive Outpatient Supervision is a 13-week program offered twice a year. Ten offenders participate in a weekly 90-minute class. Weekly sessions will incorporate evidence-based intensive outpatient treatment for individuals who are resistant to counseling. Offenders will be evaluated and assessed for treatment need. The treatment will help participants develop skills aimed at reducing criminal activity and recidivism and increasing employment, accountability, and self-worth, while enhancing public safety by decreasing crime in the community.
