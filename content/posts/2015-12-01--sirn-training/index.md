#### PROBLEMATIC BEHAVIOR OR ACTIVITY

The SIRN training was born out of the desire to open lines of communication between police and the people who work within the systems that manage adults, youth, and families involved in the criminal justice system.

#### PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

This partnership between Department of Community Justice (DCJ), the Portland Police Bureau, the District Attorney, and various community partners gives newly hired and newly sworn officers the opportunity to spend several days, learning about juvenile and adult community corrections. It teaches officers how the parole, probation, and juvenile justice systems operate and creates continued opportunities for the agencies to build rapport. Training can last from several hours on one day to several full days, and may include participants from the Portland Police Bureau’s training division, the District Attorney’s office, juvenile and adult probation and parole staff, and community partners. The agenda is developed with the intent to make it relevant for the staff that will be attending that day. The day is intended to be a dialogue to share information rather than sway opinions or practices.

#### FUNDING

The primary investment in this partnership is time of employees coordinating and participating.

#### CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

Including all of the agencies that interact with the justice-involved population we serve. DCJ, Portland Police, and the District Attorney's office work closely with partners like Outside In, New Avenues for Youth, Native American Youth Association, and JANUS Youth Services.

#### LESSONS LEARNED

This program is not about changing the minds or practices of the other agencies that interact with the clients we serve. This program is about information sharing and fostering relationships.
