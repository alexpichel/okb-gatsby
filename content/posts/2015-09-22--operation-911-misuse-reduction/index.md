Problematic Behavior or Activity

A 60-year-old woman with a dementia diagnosis repeatedly called 911 for non-emergency incidents. For example, the female would call when her care provider did not make her lunch, or when the caregiver was not at her house to give her medication.

Impact on the Community

Police, Fire, and medical personnel would respond to her apartment a few times a week. Dispatchers were fielding several calls a week, tying up their system.

Program Description

We identified a single point of contact for every call. We worked with the local fire department and also involved the son (who was the caregiver), apartment managers, and Northwest Disability Services (NWDS). This became a collaborative effort to educate the woman when to call and when not to call 911. NWDS worked diligently to find the woman a care home where she would receive around-the-clock care.

Funding

Only the time of the police point of contact and the NWDS staff member.
We did not seek or look for grant funds.

Program Impact

After the first few contacts when we educated the woman when to and when not to call 911, the calls decreased. It took a few months to find housing, but the repeated contact by the police point of contact and NWDS eventually reduced the number of 911 calls to approximately one every other week. The woman is now in a care facility, thanks to NWDS.

Lessons Learned

Single police point of contact. Police hounding NWDS to find a home for the woman. Working together with the fire department, son, and apartment manager so that we were all on the same page giving the woman the same information.
