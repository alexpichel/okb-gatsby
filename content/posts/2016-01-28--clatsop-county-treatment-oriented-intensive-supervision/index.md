Problematic Behavior or Activity

This program was developed as part of Justice Reinvestment, a statewide initiative to reduce prison use after a nearly 50 percent increase in Oregon’s incarceration rate from 2000 to 2010. As part of this effort, Clatsop County identified the need for focused services that prioritize those who are at medium to high risk, have received a downward departure sentence, and/or have not previously succeeded on traditional probation.
Impact on the Community

Without intensive supervision, this population of offenders is more likely to recidivate and continue to victimize citizens in the community. Over the past three years, 74 to 78 percent of drug offenders who entered the Department of Corrections from Clatsop County had previously failed on probation.

Program Description

The program adds a treatment-oriented intensive supervision caseload for offenders who score as medium to high risk for reoffending and those with a downward departure sentence. The supervision officer will provide more hands-on monitoring and a greater focus on offender’s rehabilitative efforts and treatment progress. Supervisees will also have access to support and education services such as housing, parenting classes, budgeting assistance, and employment readiness.

Those offenders who are unemployed or owe restitution are referred to a case aide for financial services and employment-readiness training. The case aide will also pursue and monitor the collection of victim restitution.
Based on Research

   - Use of validated risk-assessment tools
   - Use of cognitive behavioral interventions based on risk-need-responsivity principles

Funding

This program is funded by a $414,410 grant through the state’s 2015-17 Justice Reinvestment Grant Program.
