#### COMMUNITY NEED

An increasing number of police departments are beginning to implement body-worn cameras in response to increased scrutiny and calls for transparency.

#### RESPONSE

This paper reviews existing research on body-worn cameras and their effect on citizen and officer behaviors.

#### PRIMARY RESEARCH QUESTION(S)

Does existing research demonstrate a police support for the adoption of BWCs and a benefit to police-community encounters?

#### RESEARCH DESIGN

Twenty-one research articles were reviewed for this paper. These articles were located through a search of academic databases using the terms “police body worn cameras” and “law enforcement body worn cameras.” Only publications with empirical assessments of BWCs were included in this review.

#### LIMITATIONS & FUTURE DIRECTIONS

Limitations specifically related to the review itself were not mentioned. However, the identified four challenges related to future research. First, more studies should be conducted using random control trials (RCTs) or quasi-experimental design. Second, it is important to consider the impact of selection effects. It is possible that the characteristics of agencies and officers who choose to implement BWC and participate in research studies may underestimate effects of BWC. The third challenge centers on the idea of treatment diffusion – that behaviors of officers and citizens in the control group (no BWC) may be influenced during interactions with an officer in the treatment group (with BWC). Lastly, there is the issue of adherence to activation policies – are officers turning cameras on when required? Adherence to appropriate activation practices closely relates to the success of BWCs.

#### RESEARCH FINDINGS

**BWC effects on citizens**

One of the goals of implementing BWCs is to increase the public’s perception of the police, leading to better police-public encounters.

*Citizen complaints*

All studies analyzed showed a reduction in complaints. However, the result varied in whether the reduction was between the treatment and control groups or was an average decrease across the agency pre- and post-implementation. 

*Citizen resistance to officers*

Studies that examined the idea that BWC would reduce officer assaults provided mixed results, possibly related to differences in experimental design. 

*Citizens’ perception of police behavior*

Studies showed limited evidence that BWC may improve citizens’ perception of police legitimacy. 

**BWC effects on officers**

Another goal of implementing BWCs is to affect officer behavior positively, which should, in turn, lead to greater legitimacy and lower misconduct.

*Officer Attitude*

Three studies found that perceptions improved post-implementation, but officers’ skepticism towards the size of impact of BWCs on citizen cooperation and officer professionalism increased. One study found that officers’ were concerned with the media using BWC footage against them. Additionally, a study found that “the attitudes of other officers in the same social network” related strongly to a single officer’s perception. 

*Officer Behavior*

Officers with BWCs are less likely to use force; however, researchers found that UOF closely relates to the discretion an officer has to turn the camera on and off. UOF decreased when officers were in “high compliance” with on/off policies. 

Officers with BWCs were less likely to stop-and-frisk. 

Officers with BWCs were more likely to make arrests in cases of intimate partner violence (IPV). Additionally, IPV cases in which the officer was wearing a BWC were more likely to have charges filed, be pursued by the DA’s office, and results in a conviction.

#### MAIN IMPLICATIONS

Overall, there is evidence that BWCs may improve police-public encounters. Areas to consider before implementing a BWC program include:
- Privacy concerns
- Activation guidelines
- Effective storage and review of BWC footage (IACP includes recommendations here).
- Clear communication with staff regarding footage usage (i.e. possible training use, how it will/will not relate to discipline, footage retention, etc.)
