Problematic Behavior or Activity

This program was developed as part of Justice Reinvestment, a statewide effort to reduce prison utilization after a nearly 50% increase in Oregon’s prison rate between 2000 and 2010. In order to meet the goals of Justice Reinvestment, Malheur County sought to increase the number of defendants offered downward departures to community supervision rather than prison and the number of Short Term Transitional Leave applicants accepted by the county.
Impact on the Community

Repeat criminal behavior and substance abuse increases victimization within the community. In Ontario, Malheur County’s largest city, the total reported crime rate is 82.66 per 1,000 residents. The property crime rate is 75.43 per 1,000 residents.

Program Description

Malheur County’s Justice Reinvestment Supervision program is a comprehensive treatment and supervision program for offenders with a history of substance abuse and/or property crimes, as well as those that qualify for a downward departure or Short Term Transitional Leave. Once in the program, the offender is placed on intensive supervision and receives wrap-around services including alcohol and drug treatment, cognitive behavioral therapy, mental health treatment and assistance with basic needs. STTL offenders are also provided safe, clean and sober housing until they become employed and engaged in treatment.

For those entering the program pre-sentencing, qualifying defendants are assessed and there is consultation between Parole and Probation and the DA’s office regarding the offender’s appropriateness for community supervision.
