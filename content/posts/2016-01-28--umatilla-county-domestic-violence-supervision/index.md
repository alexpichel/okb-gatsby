#### PROBLEMATIC BEHAVIOR OR ACTIVITY

In Umatilla County, misdemeanor domestic violence offenders have not been supervised in the community since 2007. Without a supervising officer, defendants may not follow court-ordered conditions of bench probation or enter an approved domestic violence intervention program. When offenders are not held accountable, they are more likely to commit new crimes, which may lead to a new felony arrests and convictions.

#### IMPACT ON THE COMMUNITY

According to Umatilla County’s recent countywide violence assessment, three-quarters of public safety partners identified domestic violence as one of the two highest priorities in the county. In 2014, 127 Umatilla County Circuit Court cases resulted in 291 domestic violence–related charges. Of those cases, 70 percent were charged as misdemeanors and therefore not subject to community supervision. Without any accountability, these offenders are more likely to continue to harm their victims and the community.

#### PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

The Domestic Violence Supervision program builds on current community supervision services. Offenders are assessed using the Level of Service/Case Management Inventory (LS/CMI) and the Ontario Domestic Assault Risk Assessment (ODARA), an actuarial risk-assessment tool specific to domestic violence offenders. One probation officer is assigned the case management of all misdemeanor domestic violence offenses. Offenders assigned to this caseload will have access to other supervision services including alcohol/drug treatment, cognitive behavioral therapy, Moral Reconation Therapy, day management programs, and electronic surveillance. If directed by the court, they will be required to submit to batterers intervention treatment.

#### BASED ON RESEARCH

- Use of validated risk tools including the LS/CMI and ODARA
- Adherence to risk-needs-responsivity principles
- Use of Effective Practices for Supervisional Corrections (EPICS) for officer training

#### FUNDING

This program is funded by a $157,930 grant through the state’s 2015-17 Justice Reinvestment Grant program.
