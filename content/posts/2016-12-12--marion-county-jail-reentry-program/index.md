#### PROBLEMATIC BEHAVIOR OR ACTIVITY

The Jail Reentry Program’s target population is medium- to high-risk drug-dependent men at the Marion County Transition Center who are serving serving a county supervisory authority felony “prison” sentence of one year or less. Historically in Marion County, this population of offenders has produced the highest recidivism rates compared to the general jail population. Evidence-based research shows that the first 90 days after release from jail or prison are the most risky for people in terms of rearrest. Their successful reintegration is significantly enhanced by providing quality transitional services during this period. The program was developed to build on the success of other Marion County reentry programs that have significantly reduced recidivism rates, from a high of 37 percent in 2002 to a low of 14 percent in 2014.

#### IMPACT ON THE COMMUNITY

Taxpayers benefit from reductions in recidivism and the costs of incarceration. The average cost of incarcerating a person in Oregon is $84 per day. Marion County’s most-intensive reentry treatment program costs $39 per day. The community benefits directly from reduced costs, less crime, and the economic contributions made by ex-offenders who are employed. Families benefit when they can be safely reunited and the person who was incarcerated can contribute physically, emotionally, and financially to the well-being of the family unit. Business benefits from reductions in crime and the option of employing successful and motivated ex-offenders. And those individuals obviously benefit by staying in and contributing to the community.

#### PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

The Jail Reentry Program involves 90 days of treatment delivered by multiple agencies to successfully prepare Marion County Transition Center inmates to transition when they return to the community. Approximately half of the program is delivered in-custody at the Transition Center, with the remainder delivered in alternative custody in the community, such as through electronic monitoring or day reporting programs. Each reentry program group receives an array of services to address specific criminogenic risk factors. The program is delivered in collaboration with the Transition Center, Bridgeway Recovery Services, and the De Muniz Resource Center.
Services include prerelease reach-ins, case planning, motivational and cognitive programming, alcohol and other drug treatment, parenting classes, employment services, housing, mentoring, and access to the De Muniz Resource Center, located at the Transition Center.

All program participants are reviewed, interviewed, and screened by the Transitional Center counselor, who also serves as the supervision officer during the initial 45 days of programming. Once a client completes the first half of the program, supervision is transferred to the Parole and Probation Division Transitional Services Unit for the remainder of the sentence, through post-prison supervision. Bridgeway Recovery Services provides a continuum of care of outpatient substance use treatment. Assessment of criminogenic risk and need are part of treatment and mentoring services, to track progress and identify obstacles. Treatment services include motivation, cognitive programming, substance use programming, education, anger management, self-management, and problem-solving skills. Individual mentoring support accompanies direct treatment services to assist people in their transition.

#### BASED ON RESEARCH

The Jail Reentry Program adheres to a risk-needs-responsivity framework. Each group receives services to address specific criminogenic risk factors. The program uses evidence-based risk and needs assessments, such as the [Public Safety Checklist](https://risktool.ocjc.state.or.us/psc/) and the Level of Service/Case Management Inventory (LS/CMI).

#### FUNDING

The program is partially funded by dedicated state Justice Reinvestment grant funding. That funding covers two deputies at the Transition Center, including one counselor. The remainder of the funding is built into the Marion County Sheriff’s Office budget.

#### PROGRAM IMPACT

Proposed outcome measures:

In 2015, 59 percent of all people referred to the program graduated. Future outcome measures are expected to reflect:

* Reductions in recidivism
* Reductions in participants testing positive for alcohol or illegal substances
* Increases in participants successfully completing program requirements
* More post-release participants securing employment
* More post-release participants securing housing
